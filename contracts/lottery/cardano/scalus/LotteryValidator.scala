/** A lottery between two players, where each of them commits a bet and the winner takes both bets.
  * Since Cardano is deterministic, this lottery uses a commit-reveal-punish scheme to ensure
  * fairness.
  *
  * The scheme works by two players commiting a secret beforehand, and using the preimages of the
  * secrets to determine a winner using a fair function, in this case, a `mod(2)` of the pre-images
  * lengths.
  *
  * The lottery starts off with a multisig transaction that commits both players bets to the
  * contract. Then, the lottery is considered [[LotteryState.Empty]].
  *
  * Then, any of their players can issue a Reveal action, supplying their preimage.
  *
  * After that, any action ends the lottery. The valid actions are:
  *
  * 1) The second player reveals their secret. The revealing player in this case already knows the
  * outcome of the lottery, and by doing their reveal, claims a victory. The player supplies the
  * preimage so that the contract can confirm their victory, and gets their payout. If the supplied
  * preimage does not hash to the initially commited secret, the validator fails, allowing the first
  * player to claim the pot via a [[Action.Timeout]] after a delay.
  *
  * 2) The second player concedes the pot by sending an [[Action.Lose]]. As explained above, the
  * first players reveal has given the second player information to determine their loss.
  *
  * 3) If the second player has failed to reveal the secret, the first player can claim the pot via
  * a [[Action.Timeout]] after a specified delay.
  *
  * @note
  *   It's *recommended* that the players use preimages that are at least 32 bytes long to ensure
  *   security of their secrets. Otherwise, a malicious player could guess their opponents preimage
  *   by using a brute force attack against their secret.
