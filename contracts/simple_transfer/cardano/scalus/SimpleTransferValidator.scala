/** https://github.com/blockchain-unica/rosetta-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/simple_transfer
  *
  * Simple transfer
  *
  * The contract allows a user (the owner) to deposit native cryptocurrency, and another user (the
  * recipient) to withdraw arbitrary fractions of the contract balance.
  *
  * At contract creation, the owner specifies the receiver's address.
  *
  * After contract creation, the contract supports two actions:
  *
  *   - deposit allows the owner to deposit an arbitrary amount of native cryptocurrency in the
  *     contract;
  *   - withdraw allows the receiver to withdraw any amount of the cryptocurrency deposited in the
  *     contract.
