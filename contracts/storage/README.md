# Storage

## Specification


The contract Storage allows a user to 
store insiede the blockchain two 
typologies of dynamic size data: 
a byte sequence and a string.

After contract creation, the contract 
allows two actions:
- **storeBytes**, which allows the user
to store an arbitrary 
sequence of bytes (1 to 5 bytes, 128 bytes);
- **storeString**, which allows the user 
to store a string of arbitrary 
length (1 to 5 simple characters, 128 simple characters).
