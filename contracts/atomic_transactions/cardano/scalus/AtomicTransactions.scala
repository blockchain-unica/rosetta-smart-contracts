  *
  * On EVM chains, performing several actions atomically requires a contract that batches sub-calls
  * and rolls back on failure. On Cardano every transaction is atomic by the ledger rules: all
  * inputs are consumed and all outputs are created in a single step, or nothing changes at all. So
  * "batching" needs no contract — it is just spending several UTxOs in one transaction.

      * Either all of those inputs are consumed and the payment is made, or the whole transaction is
      * rejected by the ledger — there is no partial outcome. That all-or-nothing guarantee is the
      * atomicity an EVM batching contract would have to implement by hand.
