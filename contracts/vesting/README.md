# Vesting

## Specification // alvi: manca l'elenco della funzioni (Ã¨ menzionata solo la release)

The Vesting contract involves a funder 
and a beneficiary.
The contract acts as a trusted 
intermediary to implement a 
time-costrained custody of the deposited 
amount until its vesting.

At any time, the beneficiary 
can get the remaining vested 
amount, according to a liner 
vesting curve. 

The funder initializes the contract by 
setting: 
- the beneficiary, 
- the start timestamp 
- the duration.
- the funder sends to the contract the 
amount to 
be vested.

After contract creation, the Vesting 
allows one action:
- **release**, which sends to the 
beneficiary the amount of the remaining 
vested amount 

## Expected Features

- Asset transfer
- Abort conditions
- (External) contract call

## Implementations

- **Solidity/Ethereum**: implementation coherent with the specification.
- **Anchor/Solana**:  a step has been added for initializing the data of the vesting (beneficiary, start, duration, etc.).
- **Aiken/Cardano**: implementation coherent with the specification.
- **PyTeal/Algorand**: implementation coherent with the specification.
- **SmartPy/Tezos**:
- **Move/Aptos**: implementation coherent with the specification.
