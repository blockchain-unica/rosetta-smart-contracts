# Anonymous data

## Specification

This contract allows multiple users to store data on-chain. Stored data is associated with a cryptographic hash in a way that only the user who can generate that hash can retrieve it.

Once the contract is deployed, it supports the following actions:
- **getID**: the user gets the cryptographic hash of their address, salted with a freely chosen nonce passed as an argument.
- **storeData**: if data is not already associated, the user associates binary data to their ID, as obtained with getID.
- **getMyData**: the user passes the nonce used to generate the ID and retrieves the stored data.

Note: a user can always use a new nonce to generate a new ID and store new data.

## Required functionalities
- Dynamic arrays
- Bounded loops
- Transaction revert
- Hash on arbitrary messages

## Implementations

- **Solidity/Ethereum**:  implementation coherent with the specification. The hashing process uses the built-in encoding function to combine the user's address with the nonce. 
- **Anchor/Solana**: 
- **Aiken/Cardano**:
- **PyTeal/Algorand**:
- **SmartPy/Tezos**:
- **Move/Aptos**:
- **Fe/Ethereum**: since Fe does not support dynamic data structures, I was forced to cap the amount of any data sructure to a fixed amount. There can only be 100 users storing data, and the stored data has to be a single uint256. The hashing process uses the built-in encoding function to combine the user's address with the nonce.
