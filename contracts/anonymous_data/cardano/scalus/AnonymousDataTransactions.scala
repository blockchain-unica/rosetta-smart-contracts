/** Anonymous on-chain data storage — implemented with **zero on-chain execution**.
  *
  * Specification (rosetta `anonymous_data`): "store data on-chain, associated with a cryptographic
  * hash, in a way that only the user who can generate that hash can retrieve it."
  *
  * On Cardano this needs no validator at all. Every transaction output can carry a **datum hash**
  * ([[scalus.cardano.ledger.DatumOption.Hash]]) — a 32-byte commitment whose preimage is NOT kept
  * on-chain. We commit to `Data.List([B(nonce), data])`:
  *
  *   - The chain stores only `blake2b_256(serialise([nonce, data]))`. Observers see a hash, not the
  *     data, and cannot tell two unrelated entries apart.
  *   - To **retrieve** an entry you reveal the preimage `(nonce, data)`; anyone can recompute the
  *     hash and check it against the on-chain UTxO. Only someone who already knows `(nonce, data)`
  *     can produce a matching preimage.
  *   - The `nonce` is what makes the commitment *hiding*: without it, low-entropy `data` (a vote, a
  *     yes/no flag, a small number) could be brute-forced by hashing every candidate. A fresh
  *     random nonce per entry also makes the same `data` stored twice produce two unlinkable
  *     hashes.
  *
  * This is a commitment scheme expressed in a native ledger feature. It is the whole point of the
  * example: this functionality requires no smart contract — just a datum hash on an ordinary UTxO.
  *
  * Note on anonymity: the storing transaction is still signed by *some* key, so on a public chain a
  * determined observer can link the storer's wallet to the UTxO they created. Hiding *that* link is
  * a different problem (it needs a relayer plus a zero-knowledge membership proof, e.g. a bilinear
  * accumulator or zk-SNARK). What a datum hash gives you, simply and cheaply, is data
  * confidentiality with selective disclosure: the *contents* stay private until their owner chooses
  * to reveal them.
