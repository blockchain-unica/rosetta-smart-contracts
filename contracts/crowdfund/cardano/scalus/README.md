# Crowdfunding

Campaign with a funding goal and deadline. Anyone can donate before the deadline. If the goal is met, the recipient
withdraws the funds. If not, donors reclaim their contributions.

## How it works

The contract datum tracks the total donated amount, the goal, the recipient, and the deadline. Each donor receives a
donation token as a receipt.

- **Create** — mints a campaign NFT and initializes the datum.
- **Donate** — before the deadline, a donor sends ADA to the contract. A donation token is minted and sent to the
  donor, and the datum's total is incremented.
- **Withdraw** — after the deadline, if the goal is met, the recipient claims the collected funds.
- **Reclaim** — after the deadline, if the goal is not met, donors burn their donation tokens and reclaim the
  corresponding ADA. When several donations are reclaimed in one transaction, each consumed donation must be matched
  to its own distinct refund output paying its original donor — the validator rejects fewer outputs than donations,
  or two donations sharing one output, so no contribution can be swept as change.

`Crowdfunding.scala` contains the on-chain validator and minting policy.
